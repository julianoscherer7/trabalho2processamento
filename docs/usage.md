. **Wiring**:
    - Connect the first 4-bit binary number to pins 0 to 3.
    - Connect the second 4-bit binary number to pins 4 to 7.
    - Connect the sum control signal to pin 13.
    - Connect the output pins 8 to 12 to LEDs or any other output devices to observe the results.

2. **Upload the Code**:
    - Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the Upload button in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Operation**:
    - Set the binary inputs on pins 0 to 7.
    - Set the sum control signal on pin 13 to HIGH.
    - Observe the 4-bit sum on pins 8 to 11 and the carry bit on pin 12.
